# The Nails Factory

The Nails Factory is a recreation of “Universal Paperclips” a game based on the idea of ​​artificial intelligence (AI) optimized for a single task. The Nails Factory begins innocently, but quickly evolves into a reflection on resource management, automation, and even philosophical questions about domination by AI. The game is a mix of strategy, economics and puzzle, where the player manages a nail factory that potentially extends on a cosmic scale. It playfully explores how a misaligned AI transforms the entire universe into nails.
